### Goals of the project: Improving Education using the Cloud

The idea of our project is to improve the student retention of ideas and concepts presented in class, by using repeating and additional resources based on the contents of the lecture. 
This is accomplished by preforming a statistical analysis of the transcript, and reporting back the keywords as determined by our algorithm... Our program takes in a *.vtt* file...


a. Education: E-Learning System using the Cloud
b. How can we increase our metrics (Retention and Engagement) using cloud resources
c. What technology can we leverage to our advantage?
 
### Desired user experience
The users of our program are twofold. The first set of users are the Professors, who only need to feed the program the subtitles for their lecture and the give weights to the specific keywords that were mentioned during a given lecture. After this has been done, our program will search for addition resources based on the keywords, with a focus on the words the Professor deemed to be most important in this lecture. 

The second users of our program will be the students. These students... output of the program, a text file with the keywords and the addition resources our program found from those keywords.


a. Increased retention and/or engagement with online learning

### Implementation details
a. Resource finder

### Issues encountered, bugs fixed or still present, and future work to be done (every project has them!)
a. TBA
